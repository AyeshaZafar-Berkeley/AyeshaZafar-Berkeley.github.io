# Ayesha Zafar

I’m a policy expert and data enthusiast who loves digging into the “why” behind global challenges. Whether it’s understanding why poverty persists in the Global South despite economic growth, why gender gaps persist in classrooms and parliaments, or how conservation efforts can be community-driven, I’m driven by one question: how do we turn research into impact?

At Berkeley, I’m pursuing my Master of Public Policy to sharpen the tools that make that possible, from econometrics to political strategy. I’ve worked across international development, public policy, and conservation, and what excites me most is bringing these worlds together: using evidence to design policies that are equitable, global in outlook, and grounded in communities’ lived realities.

Looking ahead, I want to keep building bridges between data and policy, tackling issues like poverty reduction, gender equity, and sustainability, and working with teams who believe that bold ideas and rigorous evidence can go hand in hand.
